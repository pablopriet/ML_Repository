# ML_RepositoryðŸ™‡
- This is a public repository
### Purpose
- This repository is aimed to give intuitive implementations of Machine Learning Algorithms focused on learners.
### Projects
- The first project, can be accessed at prediction-lung-cancer.ipynb , in this project a Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm is trained an validated using a Lung Cancer Open Source Dataset, provided on the Kaggle Platform by MYSAR AHMAD BHAT. <br>
I have provided intuitive explanations and  graphs of the Decision Trees and how the decision strategy for classification is used.
